# Clusters


We have a number of compute clusters:

    Rackham, reserved for SNIC projects
    Snowy, reserved for SNIC projects
    Miarka, reserved for Scilifelab production
    Bianca, a part of SNIC-SENS
    UPPMAX Cloud, a part of SNIC Science Cloud

The storage systems we have provide a total volume of about 20 PB, the equivalent of nearly 15 billion 3.5-inch floppy disks or 40,000 years of 128-bit encoded music. Read more on the storage systems page.
