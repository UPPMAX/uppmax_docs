# Getting started
In order to use UPPMAX resources, you need an UPPMAX user account and a project. Your user account is a personal log-in to our systems. Computer resources like CPU-hours and disk storage are allocated to projects.

UPPMAX is also a cluster and cloud provider for Uppsala University educational courses. See the university course information page if you are interested in teaching with us.

If the results you get from using the resources at UPPMAX end up in a paper or are presented at a workshop or conference, we kindly ask you to acknowledge UPPMAX and SNIC.
